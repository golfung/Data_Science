# Banker, Please save us from fraudsters

I have been given the opportunity to **interview** for a position as a **Data Scientist**. As part of my preparation, I created a project aimed at predicting fraudulent behavior to help banks detect fraud faster with **Machine Learning** in **Python** programming.

## Inspiration
I have heard a lot of news that many people have been tricked into transferring money from banking apps to fraudsters. As a result, many people have lost their jobs, and their families are in trouble. For some people, the stolen money is their life savings. What shocked me the most was hearing about youths who have hanged themselves after being deceived into transferring money to fraudsters.

Many times, the media only reminds us to be careful and not give personal information to anyone, or to download suspicious apps onto our phones. However, I think one way that should be dealt with immediately is through the bank's own system.

Unfortunately, financial transaction data is quite scarce in my country, Thailand. Therefore, I have used the following information to shed some light on patterns and ways to protect against scammers.

This is the source that I refer to https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1
