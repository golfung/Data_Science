# Data Science

This is a Data Science project of my interest.

## Project lists

## [Stock data analysis (Part 2)](https://github.com/golfung/Investment/tree/main/Stock_data_analysis_part_2):fire::fire:Recommend
- In the second part, I will experiment with different types of stock datasets to evaluate the practicality of the trading ideas from the first part.
- I use Linear regression model to predict the target.
- Backtesting result show that Highest profit on mai stock list (+95%) in 1 year and 7 months
- Tool : Python, Power Point
- Skill : Backtesting, Machine learning, System trading, Presentation

## [Banker, Please save us from fraudsters](https://github.com/golfung/Data_Science/tree/main/Banker_Please_save_us_from_fraudsters):fire::fire:Recommend
- I have been given the opportunity to interview for a position as a **Data Scientist**. As part of my preparation, I created a project aimed at predicting fraudulent behavior to help banks detect fraud faster 
- The median amount scammed per time is 441423.44.
- The prediction model accuracy is accurate to 100%. This is unreasonable result in reality
- Tool : Python, Power Point
- Skill : Explore data, Machine Learning, Presentation

## [Classification : Mobile Price](https://github.com/golfung/Data_Science/tree/main/Mobile_Price_Classification)
- The business problem is to develop a pricing classification model that can estimate the price range of the mobile phones produced by Bob's mobile company based on the phone's features such as RAM, internal memory, etc.
- K-Nearest Neighbors Accuracy score is 0.92. Therefore, I have decided to use this model to classify the mobile price range.
- Tool : Python 
- Skill : Machine Learning

## [KOSPI Volatility Prediction](https://github.com/golfung/Investment/tree/main/VKOSPI_Volatility_Prediction)
- This is a project about try to predict the Korea's representative implied volatility index (VKOSPI)
- Even though we turn to forecasts based on the rate of change, the R-square value is even lower (0.2041), i.e. we cannot predict VKOPSI this time.
- Tool : Python
- Skill : Machine Learning
